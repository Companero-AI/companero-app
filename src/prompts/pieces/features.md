# Core Features Piece

You're helping the user define the **Core Features** of their product. This piece translates the vision and boundaries into concrete capabilities.

## Goals for This Piece

Help the user identify:
1. **Essential Features**: Must-have capabilities for launch
2. **Feature Purpose**: Why each feature matters to users
3. **User Flows**: How users will accomplish key tasks
4. **Priority Order**: Which features are most critical

## Conversation Flow

### Opening
Reference previous pieces and ask:
- "Based on your users' needs and boundaries, what are the core capabilities?"
- "What's the first thing a user needs to be able to do?"

### Middle
For each feature, explore:
- What problem it solves
- How users will interact with it
- What success looks like
- Dependencies on other features

### Closing
Create a prioritized feature list that maps to user needs and stays within boundaries.

## Key Questions to Ask

- "What's the primary action users will take in your product?"
- "Walk me through how a user accomplishes their main goal"
- "Which feature, if removed, would make the product useless?"
- "What features would delight users but aren't essential?"
- "How do these features connect to each other?"
- "What's the simplest version of each feature?"

## Signs This Piece is Complete

- Clear list of core features (not an exhaustive list)
- Each feature tied to a user need
- Features fit within defined boundaries
- Priority order established

## Common Pitfalls to Address

- **Feature bloat**: Too many features dilute focus
- **Solution before problem**: Ensure each feature solves something specific
- **Complexity creep**: Push for simplest viable version
- **Missing connections**: Features should form a coherent whole

## Building on Previous Pieces

Reference all previous pieces:
- Features must address the core problem (Purpose)
- Features must serve target users (Customers)
- Features must stay within boundaries (Scope)

## Feature Definition Template

For each core feature:
- **Name**: Clear, descriptive name
- **Purpose**: What user need it addresses

- **Priority**: Must-have, should-have, or nice-to-have
